## Includes

It is possible to include rendered content 
of other `article` or `sample` into result of any article. 

### Including an Article
Let's include an article named `Home` you've probably seen. 

We'll use `md-view` component right here in markup:

```html
<md-view class="spectrum-Body5" article="Home"></md-view>
```

And the result is:
<md-view class="spectrum-Body5" article="Home"></md-view>

### Including a Code Sample
To include a code sample named `Icon` use `live-code` component as follows:

```html
<live-code sample="Icon"></live-code>
```

<live-code sample="Icon"></live-code>

##### :D Nuff said.
